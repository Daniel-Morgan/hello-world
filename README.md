Hello humans,

My name is Daniel Morgan and I'm a computer scientist at Michigan tech. I'm a undergraduate, 3rd year almost a senior. I'm currently taking team software class to further my education and learn more skills on working with a group. I've worked previously with 5 people on a game in Husky Game Development.
